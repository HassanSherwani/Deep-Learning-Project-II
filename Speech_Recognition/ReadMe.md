# Speech Recognition Project

 Goal of this mini-project is to build your own speech recognition model that is able to distinguish words.
 
 # Modules<br>
 
 numpy
 pandas
 scipy
 matplotlib
 tensorflow
 keras
 
 # Dataset
 
TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge:<br>
Can you build an algorithm that understands simple speech commands?
