# Project Statement

Simulate a Self-Driving Car

# Method

Using Nvidia’s research to build a CNN for autonomous driving in Pytorch

# Data

The Udacity provided dataset + Udacity’s self-driving car simulator

- https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim

# Modules

pytorch, opencv,numpy

# Content 

- Self_Driving_Car.ipynb:contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.

- model.py: contains the model architecture

-  drive.py: a Pytorch version of Udacity’s drive.py file

# Running the model
Using the Udacity provided simulator and the drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing

- python drive.py model.h5
