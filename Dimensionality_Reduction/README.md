# Dimensionality reduction

is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration, by obtaining a set of principal variables. It can be 
divided into feature selection and feature extraction.

# PCA(principal components Analysis)

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables (entities each of which takes on various numerical values) 
into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

There is use of concept. sklearn provides easier way to program. This excercise is to understand math and basic concept behind PCA.
