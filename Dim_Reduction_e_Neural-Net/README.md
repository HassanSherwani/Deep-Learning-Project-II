It was compiled by professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar from Columbia Business School, originally used for their paper “Gender Differences in Mate 
Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.” Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004.
During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. 

At the end of  their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six 
attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests
