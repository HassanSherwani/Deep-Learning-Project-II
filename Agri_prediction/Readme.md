# Aim of excercise 

This is classification problem.

 - a)-to predict the plant_id  
 - b)-to predict if the product is marketable or not
 
 # Data
 
 sample of data taken from our agri-database, which contains a number of environmental and plant speciﬁc measurements gathered during some of our experiments. A brief explanation of the columns in the csv ﬁle are: 
 
dul: days under light of the plant   

fresh_weight_plug: The measured weight of the plant

leaf_length: The measured leaf length of the plant     

led_type_id: an id that indicates the type of led used   

light_distribution_id: the light intensity

marketable: if the product is considered marketable 

nutrients_id: an id that indicates the type of nutrients 

plant_id: the name of planted species 

plug_density_m2: the number of plants per m2 

substrate_id: ad id indicating a substrate
